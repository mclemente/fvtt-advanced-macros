# Build

See the [Build](./wiki/Build) instructions.

## [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## ‚ö† NOTE FOR V11
Foundry V11 has changed a lot of things for macros, features such as **Passing arguments to script macros**, **Calling script macros with arguments through the chat**, and **Dropping Roll Tables on the macro bar** have become part of Foundry V11 itself and are no longer supported by Advanced Macros.

If you have any issues with the changes, I suggest you seek help at the #macro-polo channel on Foundry's discord server.
